# Terraform Input Variables are defined using a variable block that defines
# the variable name and other option parameters for the variable.
# These variable blocks can be place in any .tf file within your Terraform project,
# but a common location used is within a file named variables.tf.
#
# variable "environment" {
#  type = string
